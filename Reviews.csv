0	5	Tesla Springfield is the best Tesla sales and service center ever! Lee, and Frank are the best people ever! They are super nice and helpful when taking delivery of a new Tesla or asking questions about Tesla. I took delivery of a 2022 Tesla Model 3 Long Range on May 27, 2022 and they were super helpful and cool. If you need to take delivery of your new Tesla come here. They delivery experience is amazing and the delivery goes very quick and delivery is very seamless. Servicing your Tesla at Tesla Springfield is amazing! The service center is helpful and the service team is amazing. Don‚Äôt let the bad reviews decipher you from coming here. Tesla Paramus is a pretty bad store and the sales reps are not very nice. I would 100% recommend for you to go to Tesla Springfield for anyone of your Tesla needs.	1667992620	en
1	4	the future is aka I just got the tesla 2023 online wow üßøüçÄüôèüèΩ Thank you my God for making my dreams come true day by day‚Ä¶.  we came to pick it up it was only activated through the app and we went to the parking lot and there was everything you do and the staff just doing their job ‚Ä¶ but I'm the Latina always thinking that we can't do certain things but then a girl said they need help she did the process in 3 minutes‚Ä¶.. it has maintenance and there are a lot of staff outside, very friendly guys who are in the parking lot.  and the most important ones there are a couple of guys who speak Spanish that is good for Latinos that the explanation in the Spanish language is better ‚ù§Ô∏è.	1666979396	en
2	2	"Second Tesla place I‚Äôve visited in the last three months. Same problems. I just expect more from the brand. Where is the front door to the Service side? There‚Äôs no one truly there. As a customer you feel lost.
No one wants to use the waiting room‚Ä¶ wait‚Ä¶ does anyone know there is a lounge? It‚Äôs empty!
No one really cares about the customer. They don‚Äôt even seem eager to sell their cars!"	1636091516	en
3	5	Have been  with Tesla since 2015 when it was at the older smaller location. It used to be so much more fun as used to get personalized service but as Tesla has exploded in the last few years expectantly it has become difficult for them to maintain the same level of service. This is especially been the case since model Y and 3 came out. I don‚Äôt hold anything against them as when you get so many customers it is difficult to satisfy all at the high-level they used to before 2017. They still try to do the best they can.	1663981136	en
4	5	Awesome experience picking up our 2022 Tesla Model S. The technicians and front desk employees are extremely kind and helpful. Our hood was having trouble closing and the technicians fixed it in under 10 minutes. Excellent dealer.	1654368158	en
